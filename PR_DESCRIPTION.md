## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Hybrid Reasoning
```python
from core.llm_providers import LLMFactory
from core.reasoning_engines import ReasoningEngineFactory

llm = LLMFactory.create('openai')

# Create adaptive hybrid engine
hybrid = ReasoningEngineFactory.create('hybrid', llm, adaptive=True)

# Generate data with automatic strategy optimization
results = hybrid.generate(intent, schema, count=100)

# Check performance
summary = hybrid.get_performance_summary()
```

### Example 2: Explainability
```python
from core.explainable_generator import ExplainableSyntheticGenerator

# Create explainable generator
generator = ExplainableSyntheticGenerator(
    llm_provider=llm,
    reasoning_engine='hybrid',
    enable_explainability=True
)

# Generate with full explainability
result = generator.generate_from_prompt(
    "Generate 100 customer records",
    include_shap=True,
    include_lime=True
)

# Automatic reports generated:
# - Feature importance analysis
# - Decision rules
# - SHAP values
# - LIME explanations
```

### Example 3: MCTS Reasoning
```python
# Create MCTS engine
mcts = ReasoningEngineFactory.create('mcts', llm, num_simulations=100)

# Generate with exploration-exploitation balance
results = mcts.generate(intent, schema, count=50)
```
